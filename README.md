**Given the above, the following versioning pattern lends itself well to the BoJcrawling project:**

_**api.major.patch**_

- **API**: Bumped when Adding or Removing api

  *Examples:* Removing an endpoint, Supporting new website
- **Major**: Bumped when breaking changes are committed to main.py

  *Examples:* Bumping the website structure version, altering the configuration in a non-backward-compatible manner
- **patch**: Bug fixing, Adding little function

  *Examples:* Prettier fonts, Adding blanks
